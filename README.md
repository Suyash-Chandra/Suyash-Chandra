## ⚡ Who I Am

I build ambitious software.

Not tutorials.

Real systems.

Currently focused on:
- 🧠 AI-powered applications
- 🌐 Scalable full-stack platforms
- 🔗 Web3 experimentation
- 🚀 Product-driven development

I care about architecture, performance, and execution.

## 🎧 Creative Edge

I produce music.

Both require structure.  
Both require taste.  
Both require obsession.
